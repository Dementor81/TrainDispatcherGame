Place game sound files in this folder with the exact names below:

- `switch_toggle.mp3` for toggling a switch
- `approval_request.mp3` for incoming approval requests

The repository currently contains placeholder files with those names so imports resolve.
Replace them with real audio files to hear sound in-game.
