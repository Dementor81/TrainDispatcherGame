Big Features:
    ✔ uncontrolled stations should be handled by the server @done(25-08-10 13:27)

    ✔ Streckenblock (the track between stations knows if it is occupied by a train) @done(26-01-24 18:06)
    ☐ handle missrouted trains on client side. maybe it should stop at the exitppoint and the player must confirm  backing up to the station
    ☐ trains can end at a station and return as new trains
    ☐ track occupied detection
    ☐ acceleration and deceleration
    ☐ select a train to see different information
    ☐ shunting
    ☐ coupling and decoupling
    ☐ add game logic to the server to handle multiple game sessions simultaniously
    ☐ UI with an overview of the whole network
    ☐ better UI for station selection with a display which station is already taken by whom

Bugs:
    ✔ prevent players with the same name from joining the game (currently breaks the game) @done(25-08-09 15:31)
    ✔ switching a switch while the switch is blocked by a train breaks the game @done(25-09-27 17:58)
    ✔ leaving a station while trains are at the station breaks the game @done(25-09-06 13:34)
    ✔ not all server event sets the delay correctly, when the approuval comes to late @done(26-01-04 17:10) --> to be Tested
    ☐ some random delays of trains at the server side
    ☐ the server dispatch does not calculate travel times within stations
