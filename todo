    ☐ add comments to shedulded strain stops like "overtake"
    ☐ remove the halt property from tracks and replace the information with the platforms

Big Features:
    ✔ uncontrolled stations should be handled by the server @done(25-08-10 13:27)
    ☐ handle missrouted trains on client side. maybe it should stop at the exitppoint and the player must confirm  backing up to the station
    ☐ trains can end at a station and return as new trains
    ☐ track occupied detection
    ✔ 2-way tracks @done(25-08-16 19:22)
    ☐ acceleration and deceleration
    ☐ select a train to see different information
    ☐ shunting
    ☐ coupling and decoupling
    ☐ add game logic to the server to handle multiple game sessions simultaniously
    ✔ admin page with server controls and statistics @done(25-08-30 18:43)

    ✔ leaving a station while trains are at the station breaks the game @done(25-09-06 13:34)
    ☐ some random delays of trains at the server side
    ✔ not all server event sets the delay correctly, when the approuval comes to late @done(26-01-04 17:10) --> to be Tested
